Place for code I write for purposes I have


### Excel-to-csv.py
I made this when I encountered some Excel files that showed up in R as having 0 sheets. Just converted them to csv and then imported.

### data_check.r
This is a function to produce a simple data frame of NA, 0's, and column type. Works good in Rmarkdown with `kable`
